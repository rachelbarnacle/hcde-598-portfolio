	<h1>Rachel Barnecut</h1>
	<h2>Hello!</h2>
	<p>My name is Rachel. 
		I'm chugging along in my second year of the HCDE MS program--more than halfway through and starting to see the light! Prior to starting 
		the MS program, I received my BS in HCDE in 2012. I work at Boeing, on the company's HR website as a functional/business analyst: collecting, 
		refining, and translating requirements, testing, and trying to interject with user-friendly suggestions and improvements when I can get a soapbox to stand on (only because I'm 
		short, not because people won't listen). I was drawn to UX because with it I can find a way to help people, although it may be in a way that is
		subtle or invisible to them.</p>
		<p>Likes: mini-golf, naps, Friends</p>
		<p>Dislikes: ladybugs, cooked carrots, the occasional treadmill ghost</p>
