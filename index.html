<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Rachel. 
	I'm chugging along in my second year of the HCDE MS program--more than halfway through and starting to see the light! Prior to starting 
	the MS program, I received my BS in HCDE in 2012. I work at Boeing, on the company's HR website as a functional/business analyst: collecting, 
	refining, and translating requirements, testing, and trying to interject with user-friendly suggestions and improvements when I can get a soapbox to stand on (only because I'm 
	short, not because people won't listen). I was drawn to UX because with it I can find a way to help people, although it may be in a way that is
	subtle or invisible to them.</p>
	<p>Likes: mini-golf, naps, Friends</p>
	<p>Dislikes: ladybugs, cooked carrots, the occasional treadmill ghost</p>
